The code provided implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers X and Y. Here's an explanation of the code and the Euclidean algorithm:

### Euclidean Algorithm:
The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It relies on the observation that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm repeatedly applies this property until the remainder becomes zero. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**: Start with two positive integers X and Y.

2. **Division Step**: Compute the remainder (X) when Y is divided by X. If X is zero, the algorithm terminates, and the GCD is the non-zero value of Y. Otherwise, continue to the next step.

3. **Update**: Set Y to the old value of X, and set X to the computed remainder (Y % X).

4. **Repeat**: Go back to step 2 and repeat the process until X becomes zero.

5. **Termination**: When X becomes zero, the algorithm terminates, and the GCD is the final non-zero value of Y.

### Code Explanation:
Let's break down the provided code:

```cpp
long long finalY(long long X, long long Y) {
    while (X != 0) {
        long long temp = X;
        X = Y % X;
        Y = temp;
    }
    return Y;
}
```

- The function `finalY` takes two positive integers X and Y as input and returns the final value of Y after applying the Euclidean algorithm.

- The while loop continues until X becomes zero, which is the termination condition of the Euclidean algorithm.

- Inside the loop:
  - `temp` stores the old value of X.
  - `X` is updated with the remainder (X) when Y is divided by the old value of X (`Y % X`).
  - `Y` is updated with the old value of X (`temp`).

- Once X becomes zero, the loop terminates, and the function returns the final value of Y, which is the GCD of the original X and Y.

### Example:
Let's use an example to illustrate how the code works:
Suppose X = 10 and Y = 24.

- First Iteration: X = 10, Y = 24. Compute X = 24 % 10 = 4.
- Second Iteration: X = 4, Y = 10. Compute X = 10 % 4 = 2.
- Third Iteration: X = 2, Y = 4. Compute X = 4 % 2 = 0.

Since X is now zero, the loop terminates. The final value of Y is 2, which is the GCD of the original X and Y.
