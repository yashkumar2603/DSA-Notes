This is different from 3162(easy) only in the constraints, basically we cant use a double loop to solve this one. 
So we use the factors and all.

My idea to solve the problem is

1. get the factor of the number in nums1

- here is the idea to get the factor of the number in nums1
- first you need to loop until sqrt(nums1[i]) -> why not looping until nums1[i]?
    - i think you will get the time limit if u looping until nums1[i] (Correct me if i'am wrong) because
        - the maximum number of nums1[i] = 10^6 and total number on nums1 = 10^5
            - so the time complexity will be 10^11
    - so to avoid that, here i just looping until sqrt(nums1[i]) -> what is the logic behind that, why can we get all the factors of the number by just looping sqrt(n), here is the idea
    - lets say we have z = 12, and this is the factor of 12
        - 1 x 12 = 12
        - 2 x 6 = 12
        - 3 x 4 = 12
        - 4 x 3 = 12
        - 6 x 2 = 12
        - 12 x 1 = 12
        - 1, 2 , 3, 4, 6, 12
    - if u notice there is a repeating pattern after (3 x 4), so we just need to loop until i <= sqrt(12) -> i <= 3
    - for every loop process you can get the factor of 12 -> i x b = z -> i x b = 12
        - i -> from the initial value loop
        - b -> from z / i -> 12 / i
    - another example, lets say we have z = 16, and this is the factor of 16
        - 1 x 16 = 16
        - 2 x 8 = 16
        - 4 x 4 = 16
        - 1 , 2 , 4, 16
    - if u notice there is a repeating pattern after (4 x 4), so we just need to loop until i <= sqrt(16) -> i <= 4
    - you need to becareful, in this cases there is 4 x 4, so you just need to add 4 one time not twice

2. after you understand how we can get all factor of the number in nums1 with n * sqrt(nums1[i]) time complexity
    
    - you need to store all factor of the number in nums1 on hash table -> in c++ you can use unordered_map
    - lets say we have nums1 = [10,20,30]
    - 10 -> 1,2,5,10
    - 20 -> 1,2,5,10,20
    - 30 -> 1,3,5,10,15,30
    - on the hash table it will be like this
    - [x] = 3
    - [2] = 2
    - [3] = 1
    - [5] = 3
    - [10] = 3
    - [15] = 1
    - [20] = 1
    - [30] = 1
3. the last step is, you need to loop for every number on nums2
    
    - every process you need to multiply nums2[i] with k (according to the explanation on the problem)
    - to get the answer you just need to get the value of hash_table[nums2[i]]
    - if the value of hash_table[nums2[i]] is exist or more than 0, we know there will be as many pairs as hashTable[nums2[i]]

here is the example  
nums1 = [10,20,30]  
nums2 = [5,15]  
k = 2

factor of all number on nums1  
10 -> 1,2,5,10  
20 -> 1,2,5,10,20  
30 -> 1,3,5,10,15,30

store to the hashTable  
[1] = 3  
[2] = 2  
[3] = 1  
[5] = 3  
[10] = 3  
[15] = 1  
[20] = 1  
[30] = 1

loop for every number on nums2

- 5 -> 5 * 2 = 10 -> check hashTable[10] -> 3 -> then there are 3 pairs
    - (10 with 5 * 2)
    - (20 with 5 * 2)
    - (30 with 5 * 2)
- 15 -> 15 * 2 = 30 -> check hashTable[30] -> 1 -> then there is 1 pair
    - (30 with 15 * 2)

result = 3 + 1 = 4


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long numberOfPairs(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, int k) {
        unordered_map<int,int> hashTable;
        
        for(auto number : nums1){
            
            for(int i = 1; i * i <= number; i++){
                if(i * i == number){
                    hashTable[i]++;
                }else if(number % i == 0){
                    hashTable[i]++;
                    hashTable[number / i]++;
                }
            }
            
        }
        
        long long int answer = 0;
        
        for(auto number : nums2){
            number *= k;
            if(hashTable[number] > 0){
                answer += hashTable[number];
            }
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
};
```

## Another solution - 
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    long long numberOfPairs(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, int k) {

        int maxi = 0;
        
        for ( auto x : nums1)
        {
            maxi = max( maxi, x);
        }
        
        unordered_map<int, int> m;

        for (auto x : nums1)
        {
            m[x] += 1;
        }

        long long ans = 0;

        for (auto x : nums2)
        {
            x *= k;

            for (int y = x; y <= maxi; y += x)
            {
                ans += m.count(y) ? m[y] : 0;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
