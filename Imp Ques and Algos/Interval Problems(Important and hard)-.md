Asked a lot in interviews and more and more in startups as they need some good grip on edge case handling,
in these problems, to check overlap in intervals, we can also check if->
$max(l1, l2)<=min(r1, r2)$ then they are overlapping.

[[Number of overlapping regions -]] ->  almost specific to the balloon bust problem only
[[Insert Interval Leetcode 57 -]]
[[Non-overlapping Intervals Leetcode 435-]]
[[Merge Intervals -]]
[[Number of overlapping intervals -]]

These are all also in LeetCode Blind 75
