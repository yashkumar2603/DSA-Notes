A disjoint set is used to answer the question that do 2 nodes belong to the same component or not in a graph, it is a data structure.
It does all this in constant time, another method of telling the same is to just do BFS/DFS from one of the nodes, if u reach the other one then it is in the same component, else not.
but this will take lots of time, disjoint set does this in constant time.
Also it is for dynamic graphs, graphs where the shit is changing is all the time in terms of edges and stuff.
At each step of change, u can query the disjoint set and it will answer in constant time.

There are 2 main methods in the disjoint set data structure, they are findparent() and union() -> two ways of getting the union are by rank and by size.

## Disjoint Set class - 
```C++
class DisjointSet {
    vector<int> rank, parent, size;
public:
    DisjointSet(int n) {
        rank.resize(n + 1, 0);
        parent.resize(n + 1);
        size.resize(n + 1);
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
            size[i] = 1;
        }
    }

    int findUPar(int node) {
        if (node == parent[node])
            return node;
        return parent[node] = findUPar(parent[node]);
    }

    void unionByRank(int u, int v) {
        int ulp_u = findUPar(u);
        int ulp_v = findUPar(v);
        if (ulp_u == ulp_v) return;
        if (rank[ulp_u] < rank[ulp_v]) {
            parent[ulp_u] = ulp_v;
        }
        else if (rank[ulp_v] < rank[ulp_u]) {
            parent[ulp_v] = ulp_u;
        }
        else {
            parent[ulp_v] = ulp_u;
            rank[ulp_u]++;
        }
    }

    void unionBySize(int u, int v) {
        int ulp_u = findUPar(u);
        int ulp_v = findUPar(v);
        if (ulp_u == ulp_v) return;
        if (size[ulp_u] < size[ulp_v]) {
            parent[ulp_u] = ulp_v;
            size[ulp_v] += size[ulp_u];
        }
        else {
            parent[ulp_v] = ulp_u;
            size[ulp_u] += size[ulp_v];
        }
    }
};
```
