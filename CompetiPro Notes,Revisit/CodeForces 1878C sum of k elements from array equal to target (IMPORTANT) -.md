To solve this, we see the min and max sum that an array can produce when choosing k elements from it. The min comes from the selection of min k elements and max comes from the selection of max k elements. 
Since we are having an array which is just the natural number sequence from 1 to n.
We can prove that we can make any required sum from it choosing k elements as long as it is in the bounds of min and max sum while choosing k elements. 
and this the key idea behind this.
